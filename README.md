# EXAMINING THE INFLUENCE OF TICKET SALES ON ONLINE MOVIE RATINGS
## Overview
When considering heading out to watch a film, can you rely on online reviews and ratings, particularly if the platform providing the rating also profits from ticket sales? Is there a tendency for them to inflate ratings, potentially skewing perceptions of a movie's quality?

## Goal
The objective is to respond to this question using the information provided in the 538 article and ascertain if Fandango's movie ratings in 2015 exhibited a tendency to rate films more favorably in order to boost ticket sales. I will employ my proficiency in data visualization to analyze whether such bias exists.
